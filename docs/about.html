    <h4><b>Overview</b></h4>

    <p>
      The world is moving towards becoming entirely driven by
      technology. Building software for billions of people is hard. With
      the emergence of Cloud computing we've accelerated software
      delivery but development tools have lagged behind. We think we've 
      developed a model to effectively leverage the Cloud and
      now want to share it with the world.

    <h4><b>Design</b></h4>

    <p>
      Micro is an API first cloud platform built for developers. We provide a strongly opinionated 
      development model and platform which abstracts away the complexity of the cloud so developers can 
      focus on building products rather than managing infrastructure.

    <h4><b>Architecture</b></h4>

    <p>
      A Micro services architecture enables products 
      to be broken down into smaller services which teams work on and scale independent
      of each other. Each team becomes responsible for the delivery of
      their particular service which others come to use through common
      APIs.

    <h4><b>Technology</b></h4>

    <p>
      We want to empower developers to build software at an accelerated
      pace from early stage prototyping all the way through to large
      scale production deployment without having to think about managing
      the infrastructure. Micro unleashes developer productivity and is host to the next 
      generation of cloud services.
